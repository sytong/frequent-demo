# frequent-demo

`frequent-demo` is an experiment of the visualization of the [frequent-algorithm](https://github.com/buruzaemon/frequent-algorithm) gem. 

This is still a very early implementation.

_TODO_:
* ~~Add a HTML page to display the results~~
* Display results in a table
* Bug fixes
* Graphical visualization?

## Usage

Check out the code and at the command prompt type:
    
    rackup config.ru
    

Then open `http://localhost:9292` using Google Chrome.
