# frequent-demo

`frequent-demo` is an experiment of the visualization of the [frequent-algorithm](https://github.com/buruzaemon/frequent-algorithm) gem. 

This is still a very early implementation.

_TODO_:
* Add a HTML page to display the results
* Bug fixes
* Graphical visualization?

## Usage

Will add this once there is a convenient HTML page to display data.

## Development

The following gems have been used in the implementation of this demo:

* [`sinatra-hijacker`](https://github.com/minoritea/sinatra-hijacker)
* [`tubesock`](https://github.com/ngauthier/tubesock)
* [`frequent-algorithm`](https://github.com/buruzaemon/frequent-algorithm)
